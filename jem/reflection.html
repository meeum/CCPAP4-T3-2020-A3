            <h1>Out & Up.</h1>

            <p>I’m moving out this week.

                <p>Looking around now it’s hard to feel like I ever really lived here at all. Sure, there’s signs of me in the place— the big white rectangles on the front bedroom wall or the broccoli plants in the back garden bed (shrivelled from the sun yet still stretched out towards it, like pruny little hands) and of course in the space by the door where my shoes are sat waiting for my 6pm start, for me to put them on and never come back. My bags are all packed in the car. I used to feel like a piece of the furniture here, now there isn’t any left. Fitting, isn’t it?</p>

                <p>I’m a big girl now. When I’d first moved to Collingwood to start my Digital Media course I’d been fresh faced and absolutely smitten with the idea of life in the big smoke. Don’t get me wrong, I still dream of the day when I can kick my shoes off in the hallway of an Oxford Street apartment and open up a copy of Frankie Magazine to see my name grace the tail end of a freshly printed byline. I’ll bring the paper to my face and inhale, 21 years of angst and anguish and a hint of cinnamon from where it’s at some point collided with my Laurent breakfast in a biodegradable beeswax shopping bag. 
                </p>

                <p>No, my lust for life still very much exists, but I’m weathered now, slightly more realistic, tough around the edges and softer in the middle— like salami, or how I imagine Ben O’Hara might act at Christmas parties. I know now that beeswax wrap is a capitalist scam. I’m allergic to gluten. And print media is about as dead as I’d be if Ben O’Hara ever read this. Last week my long-going Frankie subscription ended, and to commemorate I accidentally dribbled red wine all over my collection as I re-read the phrases I’d highlighted as a fifteen year old ('pigeon-esque’, I must have liked, because for some reason I’d circled it about a million times in pink sparkly pen. Next to it, a handwritten scrawl; “Use this one day. Very funny.”)
                </p>

                <p>Building my portfolio was just as hard as it was nostalgic. Sifting through things that I’d written two years ago made me realise that I’ve actually come a lot further than I initially thought. Michael Dwyer must have yelled at me 600 times for poor grammar in 2018, this year I caught myself muttering the same phrases under my breath as I struck, asterisked and red-penned my way through other writer's pieces for my internship. That shows progress doesn’t it? The knots in my back would say so.
                </p>

                <p>Being honest, I just think I’ve worked myself to the bloody bone recently. Maybe I do it because I’m scared of failure, or hungry for validation or possibly because I like the idea of having some sort of silent chip on my shoulder— an excuse for staring at my laptop for three hours without writing even so much as a sentence. I find it embarrassingly hard to concentrate most of the time, I have big ideas that sometimes look technicolored and then print out grey when I try and publish them, I don’t have enough time, I have too much time, I’m exhausted. I get scared that if I make something real, and it’s the best I can do, that I’ll have nothing to hide behind anymore. Creatively naked, you could say. Although I would assume most people might choose a different phrasing. ‘Pigeon-esque’ could be a nicer way to put it. 
                </p>

                <p>But like I said, I’m moving out and moving up.</p>

                <p>There are lots of things I would change about the way I’ve done the past couple of years, but I guess the thing I’m learning about growing up is that hindsight has the capacity to hurt just as much as it has to heal. It’s truly the end of a chapter, and now, as I sit cross legged on the floor eating the same brand of two minute noodles I had on this morning exactly two years ago, I’m overwhelmed with the same feeling I got moving here and starting this course in the first place. What the fuck am I doing? What the fuck am I going to do now?
                </p>

                <p>I’m starting to think that perhaps I’ll just feel like this forever. I don’t really mind anymore.
                    You helped me see that everyone else probably does too. 
                    </p>

                    <p>So stay in touch Rikki, I’m going to do some great things very soon. 
                    </p>

                    <p>Thanks for believing in me,
                        </p>
                        <p>Jemma.
                        </p>

                        <h1>& Here's The Stuff For The Rubric...</h1>

                        <p> Starting this portfolio project I was very adamant that I wanted to create something quite simplistic that was still able to show off my desired work. As I have decided that I’m more interested in pursuing a career as a journalist or copywriter, I chose to hone in creating a space for them instead of busying up my page with a large variety of different styles/types of other work that I have completed over my studies.</p>

                        <p> When starting my website, I set out a list of tasks that had to be completed in order to turn over the finished product. As I coded this website from scratch using Github and Visual Studio Code, the first step in this process was building a digital style-guide that I could use as a base template for all of my linked pages. This including picking a colour palette, fonts, styling heading sizes and types, styling links, working out how I wanted to structure embed codes and images, creating different base layouts to use throughout my page, and fundamentally creating a reference page that I could then use to style the rest of my digital portfolio. </p>
                        
                        <p> In creating this, I took heavy inspiration from other copywriter’s/journalist’s websites that I admire. One of the biggest inspirations was the website of Isabella Trimboli, who runs Gusher Magazine. I used this to help structure my website, as I hold a lot of similar interests to her and hope to go on working in the same field.</P>
                        
                        <p>Next, I began coding the actual website itself. I began by building the first four sections (home page, contact, work, thoughts) and messing around with how I wanted them to look. As the website starting to fill up, I realised very quickly that it was missing some umph, so I decided to create a series of gifs to use on the page that would create a but more excitement for the visitor. I created a gif out of my profile picture, adding in glittery tear drops. I also made little gifs in the gallery that I used for the “thoughts” section, with my running theme of lightning helping them to blend more cohesively into my website.</P>
                        
                        <p>Next I started to fill the website up with work that I have created over the past year or so. I decided to keep my written work relevant by putting in my most recent and noteworthy interviews. There is a mix of long-form and short-form interviews, which demonstrates my skills in both areas. In the written section I also decided to include some reviews I have done, along with some opinion pieces and memoirs to show a diverse range of skills, and prove that I am a dynamic writer who is comfortable across many topics.</p>
                        
                        <p>Lastly, I decided I wanted to also showcase some of my audio/video pieces, to once again prove that I am a multi-platform creative. I added in a few of these in a page titled ‘extras’.</p>
                        
                        <p>Whilst coding the website took a lot of extra time, I think it really helped me to gather a better understanding of how code works. In the future I’d like to build on it, adding some extra cool features so that people can see that I can build websites also. I’ve really enjoyed doing this, and have purchased a SuperHi package to continue learning and expanding my skills in this area.</p>
                        
                        <p>In the future I would also love to include a lot more poems, and be able to showcase them in a way that is much more exciting. In terms of showcasing my creative and personal work, I still have a long way to go— however I’m proud that I’ve been able to publish these and I think it’s the beginning of the long and exciting journey ahead.</P>

                            <p>Whist this last trimester was an awesome time for me, this trimester was a struggle as I began working again and was unable to manage my time well. I definitely bit off more than I could chew, working over full time hours in a hospo job that emotionally and physically drained me. This rendered me exhausted and limited my creativity. It’s a shame because having experienced uni without working last trimester, it showed me how successful, creative and organised I have the capacity to be when I just allow myself the time. Moving forward in the industry, this is something I will have to work on. Saying no is hard for me, but I guess it’s time to start saying yes more to the things that make me happy instead.</P>
