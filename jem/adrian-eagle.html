            <h1>The Soaring Trajectory of Adrian Eagle.</h1>
            <p><strong>Adrian Eagle remembers the exact moment his debut EP MAMA went public. The multi-award winning
                singer-songwriter from Adelaide had been hanging backstage at the Corner Hotel with fellow Triple-J
                Unearthed success Toni Watson (Tonnes and I) after their second show of her inaugural National tour at
                the end of last year. High on adrenaline and surrounded by a close knit group of crew and loved ones,
                when the clock finally struck midnight on the 19th of September he’d broken down in tears, overcome with
                a lifetime’s worth of emotion. “It was just that crazy feeling,” he tells me, almost exactly 8 months
                later and sporting a contagious smile that’s visible even over the phone. “Just the feeling of knowing
                that once it’s out for the people, it’s out there forever, and for as long as Earth exists… It’s artwork
                from my heart and it’s out there."</strong>
            </p>

            <p>Bold, self-assured and remarkably cognisant, it’s hard to image Adrian any differently. Throughout our
                conversation he speaks with conviction, never once faltering in his message. When I stutter or stumble
                over the question in front of me he’s patient, answering with kindness and warmth.
            </p>

            <p>Words, he says, have the capacity to change the world—and while the journey to this discovery hasn’t been
                an easy one by any means, he’s doing everything he can to make up for lost time.
            </p>

            <p>“Music is so influential you know…” he proclaims, when we finally sit down to chat on Monday morning.
                “Humans are so influential. I’ve been victim to evil music before where I would just listen to this sort
                of toxic undertone in a lot of lyrics.”
            </p>

            <p>“Sometimes the more positive and loving lyrics are deemed as corny or not cool, so I guess what I was
                definitely trying to do was make music that could be soulful, and sort of lift the spirit as well as
                lift my own spirit.”</p>

            <p>It’s 2020, and anger has never been more on-trend. We’re a generation that seems to pride ourselves on
                either our rash and often dramatic hatred (cue cancel culture and twitter feminism) or worse yet, the
                ability to appear completely apathetic— painting ourselves out as perfect connect the dots replicas of
                ‘too cool to care’.
            </p>

            <p>Whether it’s in the music we listen to, the ideas we romanticise or the people we envy, most of us have
                probably fallen victim to hate’s sturdy grip at some stage. For Adrian, it’s not so much learning to
                stop these feelings, but about channelling them into something good instead.
            </p>

            <p>“Music has that platform to literally put words into the community,” he gushes, excitedly. “To put
                chants, and mantras into the community, especially when it’s going on radio or out to new people. It’s
                such a high level of importance to me. It’s a fun process as well, and I definitely feel how it can make
                a change— even if it’s just one person’s life.”
            </p>

            <p>‘A.O.K’ stands for Acts of Kindness, and is not only the third track on last year’s six song collection—
                but an uplifting reminder of the responsibility you have for the space around you. It’s an anthem of
                resilience, love, and most importantly, the power of positivity. From a rising hip-hop artist, the
                revelation is refreshingly peculiar.
            </p>

            <p>
                Although Adrian admits “there’s people out there who might hear ‘A.O.K’ and think ‘shut this shit off
                man!’” He says he completely understands. “I have experienced the jealousy, the negativity, that sort of
                not understanding my sound or that kind of vibe but it’s okay. It’s alright, because it’s such a huge
                world.”</p>

            <p>“What I’ve realised is, the people at my shows are very much like me, as in they’ve maybe been through
                something traumatic in their life, or have just been through something where they’ve had enough of it
                and they’re not trying to settle for that type of environment— not trying to settle for that type of
                brainwashing or that type of negativity anymore.”
            </p>

            <p>Adrian was just seventeen years old when he stopped trying to kill himself. It’s a line he sings in his
                break-out hit ‘17 Again’, and something that’s managed to resonate with not only himself but the
                thousands of people who now listen to it everyday. It depicts one of the toughest periods of his life,
                encapsulating the story of his struggle with both physical and mental health, but also the clear message
                of his music overall. Hold on, things get better.
            </p>

            <p>“A lot of the time it’s other people’s negativity that can bring us down. Other people’s nastiness, or
                meanness and in-compassionateness in themselves, so it takes the other side to balance us out a bit,” he
                explains. </p>

            <p>
                “I guess if you tune into my music, you’re going through the same emotions I’ve been through, and you’re
                looking for that positive reaffirmation that life is a journey, and to keep on going because everything
                is possible as far as you know. My life is that story… and that’s the reality, to never give up.”
            </p>

            <p>Adrian’s working hard on some pretty big stuff right now (“man, my tail is wagging just thinking about
                it. I’m so happy!”) and although we can’t yet disclose any specific dates, keep a keen eye out on his
                Spotify and socials for updates. Until then, check out MAMA here.
