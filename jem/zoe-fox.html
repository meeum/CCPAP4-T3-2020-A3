                <h1>"I didn't want to keep making people sad": Zoe Fox and The Gravity of the Galaxy.</h1>


        <p>
            <strong>“Always lost in time and space,” Zoe Fox sighs over the phone on a chilly April morning. We’re both
            perched in our back-yards, dressed in pyjamas and taking it in turns to sip coffee in between exchanged
            giggles. Zoe’s growing carrot, beetroot, radish and sugar snaps in the garden bed in front of her (which she
            stresses “is an actual bed frame!”). I’m growing a zucchini plant that has never flowered, and a lot of weeds.</strong>
            </p>

           <p> “To my right side is what we call Herb Avenue,” she explains, matter-of-factly, “...and then there’s the
            succulent garden in front of me. There’s some chickens, and a lemon tree...and the best thing is...” You can
            hear the sparkle in her eyes. “In front of me there’s a helicopter tree— you know those helicopters? And they
            do little whizzy dizzies all the way down to the ground? There’s heaps of them, and they’re about to pop, you
            know? They’re just hanging there and teasing me. On a windy autumn day they’re all going to come
            spiralling down and I’m going to dance underneath them!”</p>

            <p>A lot of things about Zoe demand attention. She’s effortlessly charismatic—and even as we chat about the
            painfully mundane she exudes a lust for life that’s not only magnetic, but inexorably compelling too. I can
            see her dancing in that garden, entwined in an explosion of magnificent green, much like I can see her
            dancing beside the “tiny little robots in tiny little rowboats” every time I listen to the ninth track of her debut
            record Clockwerks. Zoe Fox doesn’t just tell stories, she makes you believe them.</p>

            <p>In late 2013, a video appeared on Youtube framing a girl in a green dress. With an acoustic guitar cradled in
            her arms, she begins a three minute ballad, never once looking at the camera accept to announce the name of
            the song, ‘New Note’. “I’m gonna move to a new town, change my name and wear a costume around,” she
            croons, carefully tracking her fingers as they dance from fret to fret. “So no-one knows I was erroneous, or in
            the way, and I was blue...” It’s beautifully confounding. I realise I’m crying a little bit when the screen fades
            to black and I’m left staring into my own reflection.</p>

            <p>“It was great to hear this one live this evening at the Maytiss'bar "du May sur èvre” reads a comment below.
            Underneath, a string of seperate users gush words of praise. A man in a red beanie compares the young
            songstress to Norah Jones. Another says he “instantly fell in love”. When I ask Zoe about her early career,
            she doesn’t seem quite as enthused.</p>

            <p>“I was writing really angsty, like teenage-folky-acoustic stuff about ‘what does it all mean?’” She smiles.
            “When I was nineteen, I got to go and do a solo folk tour in France, and that was an incredible experience,
            but I just remember feeling a bit alone, and a bit sad in France.”</p>

            <p>“I remember once, I was so nervous for this concert, and I went into my dressing room afterwards and I
            climbed under the table and just sat in a little ball and was like ‘oh, what have I done? I need to make myself
            so tiny now’. I didn’t know if I was good, I didn’t know if I was bad.”</p>

            <p>“Even though it was romantic, I was like ‘I just want to have a band! I just want to dance!’ I didn’t want
            people to just fall asleep and cry, because I didn’t want to keep making people sad. I wanted to make
            people groove, and shake their booties.”</p>

            <p>Zoe is an obvious lover of words, and she tells me a lot of her earlier songs were inspired by “all the
            characters in [her] head”. The title of her debut album Clockwerks takes name from Tom Robbins’ ‘Even
            Cowgirls Get The Blues’. The first track ‘Perfume’: ‘Perfume: The Story of a Murderer’ by Patrick Süskind.
            In her live shows she is exuberant, often sporting a reflective silver space-suit complete with knee high white
            boots and matching sunglasses. She’ll glide from one end of the room to the other, picking up cowbells, setting off alarm clocks, cackling into the microphone in front of her with a wide and contagious grin. Like
            an author, Zoe creates entire universes within the the music she performs. Maybe that’s why they call it
            cosmic-pop.</p>
            
            <p>“I am so happy for people to just take whatever they want to take from it,” she chimes, when I ask about the
            message behind the album. “It’s like, when you read a book like ‘Harry Potter’ or something, you create your
            own kind of world for what the author is describing. You have your own little version of Ron, you’ve got
            your own image of Hogwarts... I’ve got my own world for all of those songs.”</p>

            <p>“I go to a place every time I play ‘Tiny Little Robots’, that is unique to the limits, or limitlessness, of my
            own brain. I would totally encourage everyone to create their own world’s within that. Take it however you
            want to take it. When I write a song, sometimes I don’t even know what it means until like two years later.
            And I’m like ‘wow! That’s what this song’s about’.</p>
            
            <p>Almost like a premonition? I ask.</p>

           <p>She laughs: “Yeah. There’s a future Zoe in a parallel universe that’s leading me on this musical treasure hunt,
            leaving me these musical melody clues and then it’s just exactly the medicine that I need when I realise. It’s
            like ‘ohhhh that’s why I wrote that. I was talking about this’. Songwriting is such a mystery like that.”</p>
            
            <p>Zoe and her Rocket Clocks have spent the last 5 years winning over Melbourne with their cosmic powers.
            Up until now, they’ve only ever had three singles released. With Clockwerks now gracing our playlists, it’s
            been exciting to see how they’ve progressed musically. It’s been a long time coming, with some of the songs
            having been in the works for years. It’s no surprise really, Zoe’s always been a songwriter.</p>
            
            <p>“The first song that I ever wrote?” She grins. “Yeah I remember! I was in grade two, and I was travelling
            around Australia with my family in this 1970’s Toyota Land-Cruiser. Mum was home schooling me and my
            sister Kiara, and she used to give us different projects. Someday’s it was like, ‘ok, when we go into this
            restaurant,’” she pauses. “—Not that we’d go to restaurants, it would usually be a dingy sort of cowboy pub,
            but she’d say, ‘why don’t you go and find out three things about that person over there?’”</p>
            
            <p>“One of the days we were sitting in the car on a long drive and she said, ‘ok, why don’t you guys both try
            and write a song?’ I made up this song that was about wanting to go into space and play on the Milky-way...
            So I guess space-pop was like, my fate, since I was seven.”</p>
            
            <p>For me, space has always been a scary reflection of the fact that there are a lot of things in the world that I
            don’t know, and that I probably never will. It’s a stark reminder of my mortality, and the fact that I am so
            painfully small. I wonder what it is that Zoe finds so enticing.</p>
            
            <p>“Oh, infinite possibilities!” She buzzes, full of excitement. “It’s not that I’m necessarily obsessed with the
            names of everything and the science and physics and logocentric explanations of space. I don’t necessarily
            want to explain it, I think I’m just totally wooed by it’s mysteries...”</p>

            <p>“It just means that everything is sort of possible, and I love that it’s the edge of my mind. It really freaks me
            out, but it really kind of gets me off at the same time... Everything else that you can think of has a context,
            you know?”</p>
            
            <p>I do. I’ve been obsessed with context my whole life— desperately reading between lines, searching for
            explanations that rarely give me any peace of mind anyway.</p>
           
            <p>"Sometimes the truest things come out when you’re not thinking about them” she reflects. “When you’re not
            trying to get a particular message across.”</p>
            
            <p>That’s a big shift from writing those angsty folk songs and having to put meaning to everything. Don’t you
            ever miss making people cry?</p>

            <p>There’s a moment of silence, and so we sit there waiting, still crouched in the brisk morning air next to our
            veggie patches. I finally hear an exasperated sigh.</p>
           
            <p>“Nah... I don’t think so.”</p>
            
            <p>More silence, then the curve of her lips as they twist into a smile.</p>
            
            <p>“Someone tagged me in this video on Instagram yesterday of their little kid trying to get Siri to put on Zoe
            Fox and the Rocket Clocks. It was so cute, this tiny little kid holding a Cabbage Patch Baby saying ‘can you
            play Zoe Fox and the Rocket Clocks?’. It made me so happy, it was the cutest thing ever and it brought me
            so much joy. That kid was like ‘yeah put on Dance Girl ‘cause I wanna dance!’ That’s where it’s at.”</p>
