            <h1>Unapologetic Pop and The Essence of Humanity with Elizabeth Mitchell.</h1>
           
            <p><strong>We sat down with Elizabeth to chat about her new album, the power of pop and doing whatever you want.</strong></p>
            
            <p>“I started writing songs when I was eight or nine, and it was really just because I had a lot of feel ings. I guess I still have a lot of feelings, so I use it as a way to process things. I do it almost the  same way now.” </p>

            <p>Ahhh feelings. I’ve always had a lot too. That said, mine usually don’t manifest themselves into a  string of beautifully articulated hit songs (more just a lot of Elvis and ugly-crying into the fridge at  3am). Elizabeth Mitchell on the other hand makes this stuff seem like a piece of cake. Despite  only releasing her debut album just over a month ago, this definitely isn’t the Melbourne pop-star lets first rodeo when it comes to making and performing music. For years we’ve followed and dug  her sound, and it’s super exciting to be witnessing it now in its purest and truest. </p>

            <p>Produced with the help of John Castle (Cub Sport, Hatchie, Jack River), not a single song in  the eleven track collection stutters. Pinned as the Australian answer to Lana Del Rey, Elizabeth’s  The Wonderful World of Nature is an ode to heartbreak that will make you rethink the nature of  relationships forever.  
            </p>

            <p>“I guess I struggle to tell people how I’m feeling in conversation,” she reflects, pausing for a bite  of lemon slice. “I’m trying to get better at it, but I don’t often write in the immediate. If something  is happening I’ll write about it six months later when I’ve had space to process it. Not so much  with this album though, a lot of it I really wrote in the midst of things and I think that’s why it kind  of works as something that moves through a breakup story.” 
            </p>

            <p>Rising from the rubble of a broken marriage, The Wonderful World is a polaroid snapshot of love,  obsession and human nature. Eager to experiment with different sounds and image, Elizabeth has created her own style of unapologetic pop— leaving the stereotypes behind.  
            </p>

            <p>“It felt really exciting and freeing to be able to do whatever I wanted and follow all of my pop im pulses which I didn’t necessarily do in my other projects”. 
            </p>

            <p>“Growing up in Melbourne and playing in bands— I’ve always played in bands— I think pop  wasn’t cool,” she admits. “ I’ve always loved pop music to listen to, but I think I was trying to be  a bit tough or something. Now that I’m doing this, I think doing whatever you want is actually the  toughest thing you can do”. </p>

            <p>She’s right. I watched someone order a shot of Midori by themselves last weekend and I distinctly  remember thinking it was one of the toughest things I’ve ever seen. For Elizabeth, it’s dancing  terribly to Mark Ronson whilst helicoptering a cowboy hat in the air (this may or may not have  been a story very close to home). We agree that confidence is key when it comes to making  something disgustingly lame seem cool as fuck. This said, Elizabeth’s not always so kind to her self.  
            </p>

            <p>“Take me back in time before I knew you,” she sings in the last track of the album Take Me Back,  “Take me back to when I’d never do this to you.” 
            </p>

            <p>Not many people are able to reflect back onto situations with such a frank sense of realism.  
            </p>

            <p>“I don’t know if it’s realistic or self-deprecating,” she responds “I think I’ve always had a lot of  feelings, and when you have a lot of feelings it’s also very easy to feel like you’re the problem. I  think more realistic would be ‘we’re terrible for each-other’, or ‘we’ve made something terrible to gether’, but I also think it’s cool to own your shit and be like ‘yeah, I’m a monster’ or ‘I’ve acted  like a monster’ and then to say ‘I’m trying really hard not to be anymore.'”
            </p>

            <p><strong>So is Elizabeth Mitchell’s Wonderful World of Nature essentially one of monsters?  
            </strong></p>

            <p>“Everyone thinks that they’re the good guy in their story. I don’t really think anyone sets out to be  evil, but I also think a lot of people are selfish and don’t necessarily care about the harm they can  do to others. Although I don’t think you can make a flat-out judgement about whether they’re  good or they’re bad—I think most people are both. I know I am.” 
            </p>

            <p>“In terms of the album, it was more about whether we are destined in our nature to be a certain  type of person or carry out certain patterns of behaviour. It came from feeling extremely stuck and  like I was repeating the same bad patterns both within a partnership or even in general, and being  like ‘oh is this just who I am?’”  
            </p>

            <p>She finishes the last of her slice. 
            </p>

            <p>“But I guess we’re all a product of where we’ve been.”  
            </p>

            <p><strong>And who you’ve learned from. </strong></p>

            <p>“Yeah… and who your models are. My ex and I would always have this conversation about if ba bies were born as a blank slates, and I was always like ‘Yes they are!’ which now I don’t think  anymore.” 
            </p>

            <p>“Babies are just pure ego, they grab and want what they want and they can have it because  they’re the centre of their own world. I think most people never really grow out of that, it’s  more just learning to curb it. That said, maybe others need to curb it a little bit less. I don’t like  to do things out of obligation, and I pretty much don’t. That might make me a bad person… I  don’t know, it’s a weird thing to be alive in a body.” 
            </p>

            <p>As for what’s next? Elizabeth prefaces a well deserved break before going on to explain her plan  to write 100 demos over the summer. I realise we must have very different ideas of what ‘break’  actually means. To top it all off, she’s also just about to finish up the final edits on a brand new  music video. The clip will accompany a remixed version of one of her songs (yew!!!), and is set for  release later this month.
