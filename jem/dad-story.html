            <h1>Here's One of The Things I Never Told You.</h1>
            <p><strong>Jemma Hollway is throwing herself a pity party, and this time everyone’s invited. </strong></p>

            <p>The first time I drove by myself was the night before my year 12 oral presentation. Worth almost half of
                our marks for english, I was at home frantically writing up cue cards when my Dad called out to me from
                his bedroom. His face was swollen, coloured a shade of grey I didn’t think skin could look, and tremors
                ran up and down his body like ocean waves cascading into harsh stone. He was too proud to call an
                ambulance- Dad had been this way ever since I could remember- and so I loaded him first into the
                wheelchair we’d acquired from the op shop for emergencies (complete with flat wheels that made it almost
                impossible to push), packed a backpack full of odd socks and mismatched clothing, and managed to support
                his worsening state down our front stairs and into the passenger seat of my brand new car.
            </p>

            <p>The darkness of 11pm engulfed both me and my L plates on the trip to the hospital. I’d barely driven at
                night before, and I remember steering with one hand as I dug my nails into Dad’s arm to keep him awake
                enough to tell me where to go. When we arrived they slapped a red band on his wrist and took him away
                from us. My little brother Bailey and I split a stale packet of trail mix from the bottom of my handbag
                as Mum tried to wrangle herself an earlier flight home from a business trip to come and pick us up. When
                we finally pulled into our driveway in the very early hours of the next day, we cleaned the piss off my
                new car seat covers and then ate McDonalds cross legged in the living room watching Finding Nemo. I
                remember thinking they were the best fries I’d ever had. I guess there’s just something about slightly
                soggy potato that fixes everything, even when just a few hours ago I'd been sure Dad was going to die in
                the passenger seat of a car he’d never get the chance to teach me how to reverse park in.
            </p>

            <p>The next day at school when I stuck my head in my
                locker, sobbing and struggling to breathe everyone
                thought it was because I’d been too unorganised to
                prepare my presentation. ‘Classic Jemma’, they would
                have thought, as if I hadn’t had bigger fish to fry that
                night than sticking fucking cue cards to coloured
                squares of craft paper. Go figure.</p>

            <p>Multiple Sclerosis is a neurodegenerative disease which
                effects the central nervous system, and interferes with
                the nerve impulses within the brain, spinal cord and
                optic nerves. Dad’s had it for roughly ten years or so,
                and every step of the way has been a struggle (quite
                literally). We’ve had surprise trips to the ICU during
                family holidays, falls at the supermarket, adverse
                reactions to medications that have left me with a
                Michelin Man-esque figure in place of a father (okay, this
                one was kinda funny), as well as an array of bonus
                complications such as a deaf left ear, an overactive
                thyroid and a weird eye condition that looks like
                something you’d either get from a lifelong meth
                addiction or going swimming in a freshly shat in spa. I
                know I haven’t exactly painted the prettiest image, but I
                guess that’s the point isn’t it. There’s nothing exactly
                glamorous about being sick.</p>

            <p>There’s nothing glamorous about pissing yourself in a
                disability scooter at the local footy, not from being drunk
                but because your body is failing you and there’s nothing
                you can do about it. I once had a lady tell me that I
                needed to try harder in preserving my dad’s
                independence. I swallowed my pride and thanked her for
                her unwarranted words of wisdom. After all, how could
                she possibly have known that I’d already seen the last of
                it disintegrate that Saturday afternoon when I’d rode in
                the backseat to pick him up. I couldn’t sleep that night.
                It’s not often you witness a man lose the very last shred
                of his dignity.</p>

            <p>I’ve never been the type to openly share this with
                anyone. It’s not like I keep it a secret or anything, I’m not
                ashamed of my dad or his illness, I’m just not really the
                ‘sharing personal hardships’ type of person. I am the ‘make
                a joke of everything kind of girl’. The first time I brought a
                boy home I said at least we didn’t have to worry about
                my dad ‘walking’ in on us (as you can imagine that didn’t go down the way I’d hoped). I am the ‘cry in
                the toilet
                cubicle while continuously flushing so nobody ever hears
                you’ kind of person. I may waste a lot of water and take an
                embarrassingly long time to ‘pee’, but at least no-one
                will ever look at me like I’ve got a chip on my shoulder
                (or am in any way, shape, or form dehydrated).</p>

            <p>I pride myself on my independence, and on that front I
                can thank my mum. When I was little I’d sit on her bed
                and listen to her singing in the shower. Sometimes she’d
                talk to herself instead, asking questions aloud and
                working through the solutions calm and logically, other
                times with a string of swear words attached and
                followed by an angry rendition of whichever Journey
                song she liked at the time. I’d always wondered why she
                didn’t just ask the questions to someone else, to me that
                option sounded like it would save an awful lot of time
                and heartache.</p>

            <p>I didn’t realise until I was older that the problem (my
                epiphany came last week as I stressed over the
                impending reality of a full time carer for Dad whilst
                simultaneously toning my hair with purple shampoo) was
                that half the time we didn’t even know how to ask for
                help. I’d put so much emphasis on being independent
                that sharing my problems with someone else besides my
                shower head presented itself as a completely terrifying,
                yet invigorating idea.</p>

            <p>To tell you the truth, I’ve decided that I’m getting kind of
                sick of trying not to have a chip on my shoulder. There are so
                many people in the world that have it worse than me, so
                many that sometimes it feels like I don’t deserve to be
                sad about anything, and maybe I don’t. I just think that
                sometimes it would be nice for someone to see me
                sobbing into my locker, and know that it’s because I’m
                scared and overwhelmed and frustrated, rather than
                assuming it’s because I haven’t done my homework
                (which in all honesty, I probably haven’t either).</p>

            <p>I just want a hug, and someone to tell me it’s going to
                work out okay. It’s little things like that you simply can’t
                do by yourself, and I’m beginning to realise they’re the
                things I so desperately need.</p>

            <p>Okay so maybe I’m not having a full blown pity party
                after all, but surely there’s no harm in letting someone
                shout me a few sympathy ciders here and there. After all,
                I reckon I fucking deserve it.</p>
