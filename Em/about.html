            <h2> SO MEET EM </h2>
        </div>
        <p>Emily Skelton also known as Em

            23 from Melbourne, Australia. Growing up in a regional town of Bacchus Marsh, went to local primary and
            high school there. Growing up Em was quite active in after school activities with dancing which still
            does, and doing karate for a number of years too.From a young age Em found herself behind the camera
            taking photos of the family and random things. </p>
        <p> Shehas continued this growing up, and always want to be able to capture the moment to keep as a memory.
            This passion and love, made Em thrive in her art classes at high school which lead her getting into
            University to study an Advance Diploma in Photography at the Photography Studies Collage from 2016- 2017
            and then had graduation in 2018. As uni started to wrap up Em got a job at a school portrait company in
            Geelong, starting to 2018 she is still working for them now. And while all this happing Em was
            photographing her local dance studio events, some local footy games. Em has also been able to capture
            beautiful moment of Weddings and Debutantes. Even events such as 18th, 21st and work functions.</p>
        <p>Then in 2019 Em was able to travel across to New Zealand and did a tour of the North Island. She may not
            have taken a lot of photos while she was there it made me want to go back and explore even more.
            Then shortly after that trip she start her Bachelor of art doing content creation at Collarts here in
            Melbourne. Next in 2019 she was approached by a nonprofit organisation called ‘Just One Drop’ They’re
            dedicated to raising funds to buy Australian Farmers emergency water with a focus on those along the
            Murray Darling Basin. They have ‘his & hers’ Calendars: ‘Blokes of The Basin’ & ‘Murray Darlings
            Which Em was head photography and spent two weekend's with the guys and girls and helping put together
            the 2020 Calendar. Then In 2020 has helped out again but things are different with Covid, Em has already
            spent more time helping out individuals during the week, helping plan shoots and doing social media work
            an answering everyone questions about what they need to do.</p>
    
        <p> But back to her recent studies, Em has been push out of her comfort zone of just taking and editing
            images, she has learnt new products and programs and has been able to express herself more creatively
            than before.</p>
    
        <p>If Em isn’t studying or working, she will probably be sitting in a cafe drinking a cup of coffee but
            don’t assume its cup number one as she is quite addicted to it. Em has a big heart and is known for that
            and her ability to be able to talk someone ears off about work or the most random things. Em is a
            positive and enthusiastic young girl who has a massive love and passion for the digital Content world,
            and wants to be able share moment with everyone. </p>
