            <h1>Inside the Unusual World of Dougal Shaw.</h1>

            <p><strong>Jemma Hollway stopped in for a chat with the man behind Dr. Sure's Unusual Practice in build up
                    to the release of ‘Remember the Future? Vol 1’.</strong></p>

            <p>“I grew up in Rockhampton, in central Queensland, so I think that also kind of influenced my
                relationship to music. There’s not much going on up there for creative people — or people who
                aren’t cowboys or footy players,” says the Dr. Sure’s Unusual Practice front-man, spinning around
                on a padded desk chair that acts as the oddly beige centrepiece to an eccentrically decorated
                studio out the back of his house in Brunswick. “I guess it’s a bit of a macho culture you know. Not
                to knock it too much,” he smiles, “but they voted for Pauline Hanson and shit, so that’s probably a
                good indication of where the kind of public mindset is at. I used to use music and books and
                things like creative outlets to escape all that, and to kind of create my own little world up there.”
            </p>

            <p>An oval mirror on the wall reflects parts of this world back to me as I sit opposite the artist/
                musician/producer on Friday afternoon. A pin-board completely covered in black and white
                surrealistic tattoo designs stands behind three computer screens and adjacent to a bunch of coat
                hangers suspending differently styled suit jackets in the air. To my left, binoculars swing off a pair
                of white Purge-esque masks, and above us stockings dangle from the roof, hooked on nails that
                jar out sporadically from the rafters.</p>

            <p>There’s about 8 differently coloured guitars, one drum-kit, two patterned persian rugs and a
                poster stuck up with duct tape that reads only the word ‘good’. Shrouded in a cloud of sweet
                smelling incense, Dougal Shaw sits cross-legged in the middle of it all, so obviously comfortable
                within the chaos.</p>

            <p>“I spent a couple of years travelling through Europe after high school and living overseas in
                Canada and the UK, then I came back to the Gold Coast where my Dad was living,” he tells me.
                “I’d planned to move back to Europe and had applied for a Visa to go and live in Holland, and
                then Dad had a stroke the day after I got back. I ended up caring for him for a year and a half and
                living in the Gold Coast, then as soon as he was well enough I was like ‘I need to get the fuck out
                of here’.”</p>

            <p>“A friend and I had been trying to get a band started up there, but just couldn’t really find a
                creative community for musically minded people who had similar interests", he says.</p>

            <p>"We moved down here together with my partner as well, and pretty much the whole reason for the
                move was to start a band. That was like seven years ago...”</p>

            <p>He looks up, counting the time in his head. “Yeah, 2013 when we did the move, and within a
                month of being here we had a band together.”</p>

            <p>Comprised of mates Toby Fitzgerald and Billy Dowle, experimental rock outfit Breve would go on
                to live out four and a bit happy years together, with Dougal dropping out of his art degree to tour
                Europe, despite only having a semester left of study.</p>

            <p>It must have been a hard decision to make, choosing what creative avenue was most important to
                pursue. He takes a minute to deliberate my question, twisting the hem of his Gonzo t-shirt.</p>

            <p>“Music is definitely still just one of the things that I do, you know? When I left that degree and got
                back from the tour the band kind of dissolved, and basically after being in Europe I was kind of
                inspired to get a creative space happening here to try and bring the community together a bit
                more."</p>

            <p>"I’d experienced that over there, and I realised in Melbourne I had this really extensive creative
                community — but because everyone’s creating at home now, the only time that we share it is
                when we go and perform it for each other.”</p>

            <p>“I kind of had this idea in my head of this space where everyone could pool resources, and where
                it would be possible to record music, and then make a film clip, and then have all these creatives there
                that can also do your artwork and make your t-shirts and all of that sort of stuff. So we got
                this warehouse in Brunny that we ran for a year before it got sold off to developers, and we pretty
                much did that.”</p>

            <p>Featuring 20 artist spaces upstairs and a big DIY performance area that could hold about 200
                people, the project worked to bring together creatives and evoke a sense of community within the
                scene.
                However with so much time being invested into the warehouse, Dougal soon began to feel burned
                out.</p>

            <p>“I guess my focus went there for a little bit, and I was still making music and doing artwork and
                tattoos but I was pretty consumed in the admin of running a space like that, and that wasn’t really
                what I had started it to do."</p>

            <p>"In the end it was kind of just facilitating other people’s creative endeavours — which was great —
                but I hadn’t really intended for me to be not contributing to that. When it shut down, I had all this
                time on my hands to put all the energy I’d been putting into other people’s projects into doing my
                own stuff, and that was pretty much when I started Dr. Sure’s.”</p>

            <p>Since then, Dr. Sure’s Unusual Practice have no-doubtably taken up most of our playlists with
                their own brand of whacky, almost frenetic post-punk.</p>

            <p>Since the release of their first track ‘Busy Bigness’ in 2018, we’ve seen nothing but success from
                the quartet — going on to watch The West debut at #2 on ARIA’s Independent Album Chart,
                followed promptly by massive praise for Christmas mini-album Scomo Goes To Hawaii in which
                100% of profits made were donated to volunteer firefighters in light of the January bushfires.</p>

            <p>Much like the warehouse, Dougal describes DSUP as “all of [his] different creative outlets that
                have previously all existed separately, all kind of converging into one.”</p>

            <p>What had started originally as a side-project has now become a way to filter and almost translate
                the world around him, changing perceptions and starting much needed constructive discourse
                and conversation.</p>

            <p>“It’s just kind of my reaction to what’s happening in the world,” he responds, “I think in the past,
                like with Breve, I used to make more introspective kind of music, and now instead of talking about
                what’s inside I’m kind of filtering what’s outside, and trying to look at things that I think are having
                an impact on the way that people experience the world."</p>

            <p>"So things like climate change, social media, or the fucking big banks just rorting us. All the things
                that I think aren’t really talked about in the light that a lot of my community see them, or people
                who don’t have those big commercial interests or who don’t have a lot of money.”</p>

            <p>The timeliness of the conversation is almost comical. This week it's been near impossible to
                switch on the TV or log into social media without being completely ambushed by negative
                information. It’s scary, and can often make you feel stripped of any responsibility in the outcome
                of your own life.</p>

            <p>Dr. Sure’s latest track (and taste of the new EP) ‘Super Speedy Zippy Whipper’ sums this up
                perfectly.</p>

                <p>“It’s basically a song about control — or lack of control, and this feeling that your movements are
                    dictated by some kind of outside forces,” he explains.</p>

                    <p>“It’s in the context of living in this 21st century society where everything moves really fast, and to
                        keep up you’re kind of just going through the motions and feeling like you have less and less
                        control of what you’re doing. It’s almost like you’re being dictated by some kind of entity, like
                        you’re a puppet and there’s someone pulling the strings.”</p>

                        <p>“I’ve been feeling heaps like that lately,” I admit, realising as soon as I say it that this sense is
                            definitely not unique. The empty shelves at Woolworths speak for themselves.</p>

                            <p>“It’s all getting a little bit mental isn’t it!” Dougal smiles knowingly.</p>

                            <p>“That’s a perfect example — the toilet paper thing. I read something saying there’s not a shortage
                                of toilet paper in Australia, but people see it on the internet that there’s a shortage of toilet paper
                                in Hong Kong or something and then they go out and buy shit loads of toilet paper.”</p>

                                <p>“Generally through the media we are given only one point of view. I guess I’m trying to put across
                                    a different point of view... It’s kind of like interpreting the news but in a different context, and
                                    putting that out to hopefully have some kind positive impact.”</p>

                                    <p>There’s definitely a certain weight that comes with harnessing the ability to see things differently,
                                        and I think most creatives will tell you that.</p>

                                        <p>It can be profoundly frustrating to look at something colourful and have other’s only see beige.
                                            Personally, I’ve stopped trying to loan people my rose coloured glasses. Dougal on the other
                                            hand, remains refreshingly bright eyed and jovial, even in times that seem irreversibly dejected.</p>

                                            <p>“I now approach my creative outlets as a kind of necessity rather than a hobby or something. It’s
                                                part of who I am, and how I react to the world.”</p>

                                                <p>“I feel like although generally I’m trying to tackle things that are potentially negative, I’m also trying
                                                    to put them across with some kind of glimmer of hope — you know? It seems all doom and
                                                    gloom but it’s not all hopeless. It’s not some kind of dreary thing like ‘the world is fucked and
                                                    we’re all fucked and we might as well go and throw the towel in.’ It’s more like — ‘the world is
                                                    fucked, and so let’s do something about it.’”</p>

                                                    <p>Maybe the first step to fixing the world is changing how we view the one we build for ourselves.
                                                        More unusual things have happened.</p>

                                                        <p>The next instalment for DSUP will come in the form of ‘Remember the Future? Vol 1’, four familiar
                                                            tracks set to be released later this month. You can pre-order the 7-inch here and digital album
                                                            here. In the meantime, keep listening to ‘Super Speedy Zippy Whipper’!</p>
