            <h1>The Golden Repair of #1 Dads' Tom Iansek.</h1>
            <p><strong>“When I started music, I didn’t think I deserved to be called an artist,” a nervous Tom Iansek had
                admitted before beginning an acoustic set at the NGV in 2015. He’d been promoting About Face,
                the newly released assortment of introspective bedroom-pop that would ironically help earn him a
                nomination for Best Male Artist at the 29th Annual ARIA Awards just three months later.
                Leaning onto the guitar in front of him, he tells Jae Laffer of The Panics: “I thought that I could just
                play chords, like so many other people could just play chords.”</strong></p>

                <p>It’s a Monday morning roughly five years into the future when I ask about that interview, yet the air  between us is still very much heavy with hesitation. Sitting in his studio in Collingwood, he speaks  clearly and with purpose, pausing to test each word before it reaches his mouth. 
                </p>

                <p>“That was just something I was grappling with at the time,” he finally allows. “And I definitely felt  that very strongly. I guess maybe it was this idea of taking myself ‘seriously’, and how seriously  can you take yourself when you’re doing something creative?” </p>

                <p>“It was a strange thing you know, and I guess it was an important question for me to ask. It’s  really about learning to hold all these things in just the right way.” 
                </p>

                <p>#1 Dads was one aspect of Tom’s life that was never meant to have an agenda. The early success  of Big Scary had somersaulted both himself and Jo Syme into an album cycle that whilst included  a whole lot of touring and promoting, didn’t leave much space for what he’d loved most— actually  writing the music. His first release ‘Man of Leisure’ was recorded out of a lounge-room almost ten  
                    years ago, a collection of songs that was never really meant to be anything. “It was just making  for makings sake,” he smiles. “There’s something beautiful in that.” 
                    </p>

                    <p>Golden Repair is now the third #1 Dad’s album to find itself dotted throughout Tom’s extensive  discography, and although a lot has changed in that time— this essence of naivety and truthful  curiosity is something he doesn’t see going anywhere soon.  
                    </p>

                    <p>“I’ve been wondering what’s the challenge all about? Why was life being tough, and how is it we  seem to come through it and be richer for it? I guess it’s exploring those questions… Ten years  ago it was am I an artist? Now my question is what role does suffering and challenge play in our lives?” </p>

                    <p>Drawing inspiration from Kintsugi— the Japanese art of mending broken pottery by highlighting  it’s cracks with gold or silver— the new record not only focuses on the importance of  imperfections, but on our ability to celebrate them for who they’ve made us. 
                    </p>

                    <p>“Challenging experiences— they kind of sit there waiting in a way, and art can be a really beautiful  way of helping you move through and understand to an extent, or at least bring some closure to  things that have happened in your life and the lives of people you care about.” 
                    </p>

                    <p>The final track of the album ‘Elizabeth’ teeters beautifully on the edge of both melancholic and  hopeful, written in dedication to his wife after her mother passed away.  
                    </p>

                    <p>“I was being there for my wife during the hardest thing she’s ever had to do— and I guess baring  being a witness to that, and sort of learning to be supportive and loving through that, and then  past that— helping her mend and recover. That’s a part of the golden repair of it again, and one of  the more direct bits that kind of make up the fabric of the album.” 
                    </p>

                    <p>It was exactly a year after Elizabeth passed away that Tom found out he was going to be a Dad.  He describes the timing as “curious, but very beautiful”. I guess most things in life are.  
                    </p>

                    <p>“Leonard Cohen talks about life making the cracks, because that’s how the light gets in. There’s  definitely been a lot of cracks made throughout that time if you know what I mean. It’s been  challenging, and painful, and wonderful at the same time… but that’s how the light seeps in, so  you learn and you grow.”
                    </p>
