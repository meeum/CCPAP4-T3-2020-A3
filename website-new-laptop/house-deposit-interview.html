            <h1>House Deposit are Finally Reaping Some Rewards for Their Effort.</h1>

            <p><strong>Jemma Hollway caught up with Sam Lyons and Meaghan Weiley for a toastie and some
                    self-reflection.</strong></p>

            <p>I imagine a lot of babies are conceived after a couple of beers at The Curtin. I’ve never
                seen the dingy Carlton bar empty. It glows orange from streets away, abuzz with a
                passionate energy that always manages to smell a bit like stale piss and mulled wine. The
                place had been sheltering both Sam Lyons and Meaghan Weiley from the chaos of the
                world outside it for years when one night (after many nights) they decided to channel that
                chaos into a band. 9 months and a lot of frozen margaritas later a doe eyed ‘House
                Deposit’ emerged into the world. Now, almost a year and a half since their first release, I
                caught up with the two of them to reflect.</p>

            <p>“We’d never really played music before.” It’s Sunday afternoon and we’re having a coffee
                at Kines, a cafe just off Sydney Road. Meghan pauses to exchange a sidewards glance
                across the table to co-vocalist/guitarist Sam. “Well, you had played music before.”</p>

            <p>“Yeah...” he laughs, adjusting his distressed Twilight t-shirt. “I had like a weird little punk
                band. I guess it was a bit of a joke— it wasn’t really that serious.”</p>

            <p>“On record, Sam just said that it was actually not serious and it was a joke!” Meaghan
                raises her eyebrows and the waiter looks over, quietly amused at our conversation.</p>

            <p>“It was called Spicy Boys. I dunno if you saw that meme a few years ago—”</p>

            <p>“Rename Fire Ants! It’s a Change.org petition...”</p>

            <p>Almost every question goes back and fourth like this, stories heavy with inside jokes and
                funny little details. It’s refreshing to see people so comfortable in each-other’s company.
                You don’t have to be the sharpest tool in the shed to figure out that these two have been
                through a lot together.</p>

            <p>Both Sam and Meaghan had spent time living with Dylan Bartlett before they’d asked him
                to play bass in their new band. Although the three of them never lived together at the
                same time, they’d all set up camp in the infamous Ascot Vale House at various stages of
                their lives. Complete with missing floorboards and mouldy walls, majority of their debut
                album ‘Reward For Effort’ was recorded under it’s roof. Now the place is empty— it’s
                residents opting to move on to bigger and better things. In some ways, it’s the perfect
                representation of both the past year, and the issues explored in the record itself.</p>

            <p>“I got out of a long term relationship within the first few months of the band starting,”
                explains Meaghan. “Me and my partner separated, and I think then most of the band
                went though major breakups.”</p>

            <p>Sam nods. “Yeah, I broke up with my partner too.”</p>

            <p>“—and Dyl did! Dylan had a break-up as well. There’s a couple songs on the album that were written in
                that post break-up period. A lot of stuff happened. I moved house.”</p>

            <p>“I moved house as well,” he smiles. “And then I cut all my hair off.”</p>

            <p>“Yeah me too!”</p>

            <p>
                <italic>I guess that just comes with a breakup though doesn’t it?</italic>
            </p>

            <p>Unfortunately, it’s something we all know too well.</p>

            <p>‘Reward For Effort’ is a 26 minute documentation of what was one of the most
                tempestuous years for everyone involved in creating it. Gracefully raw, each song is
                composed with a satiating honesty that both comforts and challenges the listener as
                we’re forced to confront personal hardships that could just as easily have been our own.
                There’s nothing glamorous about being unemployed, struggling with mental health or
                parting ways with the person you’d once loved. It’s nice, to feel like someone
                understands how soul-crushingly hard life can be.</p>

            <p>“It was just so unreal, that time period for all of us,” she continues. “There was so much
                going on. You can kind of hear a bit of our stress and feel our stress. It’s like the world
                had been out to get us when you listen to the songs now. But it was good, and I’m glad
                we ended up singing about that stuff and having it work out.”</p>

            <p>“It’s scary to put yourself out there and be like ‘Yeah, this is what happened to me!’ And I
                think to do it in song is a lot harder then just saying it to someone. To write it in a song
                and kind of construct it— it’s like, ‘Here you go! Listen to my problems! With a melody!
                And a guitar solo!’”</p>

            <p>“Yeah, let me sing my problem to you!” Sam laughs. “After the album came out I actually
                had people coming up to me like ‘Hey... are you both okay?’ Because they literally just
                heard a bunch of our problems for like 25 minutes or whatever. I think I’m an honest
                person but I guess like, sometimes that just doesn’t happen... sometimes things just
                don’t get asked.’”</p>

            <p>Meaghan agrees. “I think it’s really important to be open and honest about a lot of issues,
                especially mental health stuff. I guess it really is just that thing of being scared to be
                vulnerable.”</p>

            <p>Although we can joke about it now, the record is a stark reminder of struggles once faced.
                They’ve both moved on, but Meaghan still drives past the Ascot Vale house sometimes. I
                guess things never really stop hurting, you just start to think about them differently. Now
                that we’re sitting in a Brunswick cafe eating vegan mushroom toasties, I wonder what’s
                next for House Deposit.</p>

            <p>“We have some songs we’ve been playing for ages live and I’d love to record them, so I
                think we’re gonna work on that. We haven’t sat down and written together in ages so it
                will be really good to do it again.”</p>

            <p>Sam explains that they’d had a break when he went away at the end of last year, but now
                are feeling ready and inspired to get back into the songwriting process. They’re also
                branching out into different projects, a concept that’s been exciting for both of them.</p>

            <p>“I’m just enjoying my life one day at a time!” Sam grins. “We got a new drummer in—
                Danny Devlin from Polly and the Pockets and Heir Traffic.”</p>

            <p>“He’s a fantastic drummer... and he’s a friend,” Meaghan adds, “and I guess that’s the
                thing. Everyone that’s been in the band—we’ve known each other for quite a while as
                well. There’s already that mutual trust and I think that’s really important.”</p>

                <p>When I catch up with Dan a few days later in Coburg (at the house he so
                    coincidentally shares with Dylan Bartlett) he’s beaming. He’d confirmed his
                    spot in the band just a few weeks earlier, over a couple of drinks at The
                    Curtin. I can’t help but feel a little warm inside.</p>

                    <p>It’s cool, that regardless of how fucked and erratic life can get there are still
                        some things that never change. I think there’s a certain comfort in that.
                        Maybe the only house you really need is the people who make it feel like one.</p>
