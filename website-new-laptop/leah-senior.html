            <h1>Leah Senior: The Beauty Within The Mystery.</h1>
            <p><strong>We sit down with Leah Senior about her upcoming album, yearning for another life and  finding inspiration in the unknown.  
            </strong></p>

            <p>Leah Senior is stressed when I catch up with her for coffee on Tuesday arvo. Someone’s just  stolen and completely defaced her van: one she’d spent hours hand-painting with beautiful birds  and plants and memories. Both of us are well and truly sick of people sucking. Why is it so  hard for humans to let nice things be nice? 
            </p>

            <p>“Do you think people can be content? Is anyone content? Probably not.”  
            </p>

            <p>It’s definitely a heavy topic for 1pm on a Tuesday afternoon, but something gives me the sense  that this isn’t the first time the post-folk diviner has messed with the idea. 
            </p>

            <p>“I go to Zen meditation,” she smiles, “And we were having this group discussion where one of the  women was talking about how all her life she’s just stood outside in the dark, looking at the lights  inside the houses far away. She feels this yearning, and it’s kind of like she’s seeking that  aliveness of another house.” She pauses. “It’s just a yearning for the living… you have to find  beauty in the mystery.”  </p>

            <p>Known for her riddled and hauntingly poetic writing, Senior is no stranger to this. Encapsulating  an entire atmosphere out of just a few phrases is a challenge that rarely proves disinteresting for  the devout lover of words. As for the air of mystery—that happens on its own.  
            </p>

            <p>“I guess it’s just kind of the way that it comes out, and I’m not sure why it is. I don’t know if there’s  an element of protecting myself by not being as straight forward or as easy to figure out. It’s nice  having a bit of open ended-ness where people can interpret it however it fits them, and maybe  see something of themselves in it.” 
            </p>

            <p>We’ve been patiently awaiting a new batch of tracks to translate since the release of Pretty Faces  in 2017, and much to my (obvious) delight— I’m told there’s not much longer to go. The finishing  touches to the latest instalment of melancholic lullabies are almost done, and we can totally be  expecting the new record any day now.  </p>

            <p>“It’s been kind of funny because I feel like I’m probably more stable than I ever have been in the  last few years,” she says. “I feel like there’s not as much intensity to draw upon, and I’m not sure if  that’s because I’m getting older or just by circumstance… but it’s been a challenge for the album  that I’m about to put out.”  </p>

            <p>Rather than acting as a “catharsis”, Senior says the new album has been written with playful  creativity in mind. Although still personal, the themes look a little more outwards into how the  world is—incorporating a sound that’s “more poppy, more bandy, less folky”. Interestingly  enough, this change in direction was probably a long time coming.  
            </p>

            <p>“When I was a little kid I was completely obsessed with the Beatles. My Dad paints a bit— and so  he painted the photo of John and Paul from the back of the White Album on my bedroom wall. I  was sure that they were always watching me, and so whenever I was in my room I had to act in a  way that was okay by John and Paul’s standards.” 
            </p>

            <p>I can’t help but imagine how much easier it would have been to impress Santa had we been told  he was a famous pop-star instead. This feeling of judgement however has been something she’s  actually struggled with for a while— especially pursuing a creative career.  
            </p>

            <p>“Not worrying about other people’s expectations is always a struggle when you’re a self  conscious person and you try and make art, or something that’s real and truthful,” she tells me. “I  think that's the challenge… not being an outsider, but being able to step outside and feel  free doing so. I think a thick skin is something you can learn or work on.”</p>


                <p>It’s simple— to “keep on doing what you want to do and not to cave to social expectation and  pressure to get a real job or any of that bullshit.” 
                </p>

                <p>I joke that if I don’t get my ‘big creative break’ soon I might actually end up being a waitress for  the rest of my existence (and after that). She looks almost envious of the idea.  
                </p>

                <p>“Romanticising that kind of small life— I totally get that as well though. Imagine just being  someone who is content to do that. There’s definitely something to be said for that. It’s like when I  walk past those certain houses and I just long for someone else’s life and it’s because it seems so  simple. But then again… I guess nothing is.” 
                </p>

                <p>Although we can’t yet drop a specific date, keep a keen eye out for the new album. I don’t know  a lot about contentment (or anything really), but I reckon the answer could well be hidden within it.
