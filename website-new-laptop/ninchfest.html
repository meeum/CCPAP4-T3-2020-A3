            <h1>Ninchfest, The Festival Putting The Peninsula Back On The Live Music Map.</h1>
            <p><strong>Someone let me tag along to NinchFest. Here’s what I reckon. 
            </strong></p>

            <p>Roof racks are on. Thighs are chaffing. People you haven’t seen since high school are hitting you up to ask if you still have a pool. Everything smells like either sunscreen, booze, or sweat and worst of all— your parents have started sharing ‘I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here’ memes again on Facebook. Yes my friends, another summer has rolled around and despite all the shit it’s dragged along with it— turning the corner into St Andrews Beach Recreation Club early Saturday morning feels like falling back into the arms of a first love (the one who didn’t cheat on you). Pulling into the carpark, I stop to watch an older couple in matching rainbow hats slow-dancing to non-existent music. For a fleeting second I’m weirdly at peace with the world. “Oh NinchFest” I whisper. “How I’ve missed you”. 
            </p>

            <p>Okay maybe that’s overly dramatic, but that’s exactly what a long, scenic drive will do to you when you’re disgustingly hungover and running on a can of energy drink and a single Tim Tam. 
                Boasting an admirable 5 star review on Google, NinchFest is an annual community focused music festival that runs out of the Peninsula and is now entering it’s fourth fruitful year. With an emphasis on respecting the land and promoting a variety of local art and music, NinchFest has quickly grown to be one of the areas most highly anticipated events. Given my experience, it’s definitely not hard to see why.
                </p>

                <p>“I love your overalls!” beams one of the angels working the door, sticking on my fluorescent green wristband. When I realise I’ve forgotten my camera and begin the journey back to my car, I’m stopped by a weathered looking parking officer. “Excuse me!” I turn around, ready to cop a slap on the wrist but get a high five instead. “I just reckon’ you should know you’ve got a lovely smile!” 
                </p>

                <p>I take a second to consider the possibility that I’ve somehow fallen into a parallel universe where people are actually nice and genuinely care about each other. Having lived inner-city for the past year and a bit it’s sometimes hard to fathom that places like this still exist. Everywhere I look there’s kindness, beautiful art and lush greenery. One things for sure, I’m definitely not anywhere near The Tote. 
                </p>

                <p>By the time I prop myself in a comfy spot on the lawn, I’m well and truly immersed in the musical genius of Melbourne singer-songwriter Taylah Carroll as she belts away the lyrics to her new track ‘Sometimes Good People Do Bad Things’. 
                </p>

                <p>“This one’s a song I wrote when I had a really sad shower one morning” She coos, followed by a wave of laughter from all of us in the audience that have arrived a little earlier to catch her set. 
                </p>

                <p>Gracing the stage next is Kirrae-wurrung visual artist and songwriter Nola Lauch who along with her band, focuses on celebrating Indigenous art, music and culture. The Welcome To Country follows, in which we get to participate in a traditional smoking ceremony led by Steve Parker. </p>

                <p>“This will give you safe passage into the night and a safe event” he tells us, inviting us all to cleanse in the smoke. “Welcome, and I hope you enjoy”. It’s the most intimate and meaningful moment of the day, and it’s so special to come together like that to celebrate and respect the country in which we party on. 
                </p>

                <p>Easy Browns are up tuning their guitars, but when they begin it’s pretty clear that the coolest instrument on stage is the flute that frontman Zak Brown whips out to play mid-set. Their energy is electric, the band pausing to ask if they’re good for two more songs. We applaud, yelling words of encouragement.
                </p>

                <p>“I’m not asking you guys! You guys aren’t in charge!” Zak laughs. “Nah I’m just kidding, you so are. Power to the people!” 
                </p>

                <p>By this stage I am absolutely starving. I head over to the food truck that’s been calling to me all day… ‘La Foodies’. I entered into last week ignorant to the goodness of curry loaded fries. I now feel like I’ve wasted 20 years of my life. Angie and Craig if you are reading this, thank you and I think I love you. 
                </p>

                <p>Foreign/National’s set is fucking insane as always, and having toured Berlin with King Gizz, recorded songs in LA and lived abroad for quite some time— the boys couldn’t be happier to finally be playing their first show in the old stomping ground. With the Peninsula being traditionally void of a younger live music scene, Mark and Tom are pumped to see this finally shifting. 
                </p>

                <p>“We moved to the city when we finished school, so years and years ago, like an embarrassingly long amount of time ago” laughs Mark. “[The Peninsula] has definitely improved in terms of opportunities for musicians since we were younger, but still majority of people who are doing music or something like that will move up to the city. That’s where the other bands are, that’s where the gigs are. It’s a nice place to be able to come back down and chill out, but generally speaking it’s not that great for music.”
                </p>

                <p>“It’s just a really great opportunity” nods Tom. “I can’t really think of any venues on the Peninsula that are still running and putting on shows that are accessible for new and upcoming artists or even just younger people… so if you’re a young band who can only pull like 30 of your mates there’s just nothing here. It’s a shame because there’s a lot of good bands and musicians coming from this area.” 
                </p>

                <p>Speaking of good bands, you can check out Foreign/National’s new track ‘Heat’ here https://open.spotify.com/track/2LPQ63SXDONJAnvFYnsE8c.
                </p>

                <p>The grounds are full by about 5pm when Sydney based psych-rockers Turtle Skull finish melting our faces and welcome up the guys from Mini Skirt. I’m keen to see how they’re received by the eclectic crowd around us. Every other time I’ve seen them play I’ve been at some dingy Melbourne bar surrounded by a bunch of dickheads (ironically screaming along to lyrics that pretty much take the piss out of them). Here at Ninchfest on the other hand, there is not a single dickhead in sight. It’s almost weird to be somewhere where I feel completely safe and respected. Massive props to the organisers here for creating a space like this, it’s definitely not an easy task. 
                </p>

                <p>On playing NinchFest, Mini Skirt are happy to see small communities getting back on the live music map. 
                </p>

                <p>“We grew up in a real small town really similar to this, like probably 1500 to 2000 people,” says bassist Jesse. “We never had the culture to support something like this, people just wouldn’t come out to it.  We’re stoked to come down here. We’re not real city guys so it’s really nice to come to a place like this and connect to all the local crew. It would be great if there was support for more of this, but we’re stoked to be down here that’s for sure.” 
                </p>

                <p>I’m interested to know why there isn’t that support there. Good music seems to almost ooze from these kind of areas, and so surely it would only make sense to take advantage of it. 
                </p>

                <p>“I don’t know either!” He agrees. “In a lot of towns there’s pockets of this, but to get this many people in would always be a stretch. I guess the financial risk is always scary when the arts aren’t getting the funding and support they need. I guess that’s kind of why it’s not really popping off around the country”.
                </p>

                <p>If you haven’t listened to Mini Skirt, you’re doing yourself (and probably the people around you) a massive disservice. Check out ‘Pretty’ here https://open.spotify.com/album/15IsUHLattFgDyNH1wdYOp.
                </p>

                <p>When I leave the mosh after superbly dressed, no bullshit power trio Bitch Diesel I’ve lost pretty much every single thing that was in my jacket pocket. Drunk Mum’s ensure I have no time to be upset.
                </p>

                <p>Launching straight into everyone’s nostalgic favourites. Tracks like ‘Nanganator’ and ‘Vitamin D’ go off as expected, transporting me back to the ripe age of 15 when problems didn’t exist and the most important thing on my mind was whether or not Mum would let me go and see Skeggs. 
                </P>

                <p>Private Function are fucked in the best way possible. Things escalate (as they always do) when front-man Chris Penney trips over a cable and knackers himself on the side of the stage. He then proceeds to mount the staging itself to sing in a power stance from the sky like a punky and slightly more endearing Jesus. 
                </p>

                <p>My notes say “Stick with soccer ball on it? Nickleback poster smashed with head. Techno. Spits beer into crowd. Security angry”. To be honest I’m not completely sure what I saw, but if you’ve ever watched Private Function, you’ll know that you never really can be. 
                </p>

                <P>No Zu is last to perform, their punk-funk grooves keeping everyone up and dancing. It’s a pretty nice moment, and surrounded by a bunch of beautiful people it’s the perfect end to a massive day. I’m so happy that I’m not even pissed when I remember I’m spending the night squashed in my bees-dick sized Yaris with a goon bag for a pillow. If that’s not love, I don’t know what is. 
                </P>

                <P>Until next time NinchFest, I’ll miss you!
                </P>
